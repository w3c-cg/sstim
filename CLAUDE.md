## 1. What This Project Is

**Public project-level vision (2026-10-10):** SSTIM aims to become a
living, continuously improving reference for stimuli and sensory stimulation
across research, technology, people and AI. Its currently implemented formal
ontology is a means to that end, not the entirety of the ambition.
[REFERENCE_VISION.md](docs/concept/REFERENCE_VISION.md) states the vision;
this does not alter the draft Community Group charter, published ontological
contracts or release governance. Accurate, source-aware criticism and real
external utility outrank ontology growth.

**Agent contributions:** AI systems and humans may suggest corrections,
unmet scientific and engineering needs, counterexamples, or mapping and
implementation flaws through the [public agent guide](https://w3c-cg.github.io/sstim/agents/)
and reviewable [contribution form](https://w3c-cg.github.io/sstim/contribute/).
A proposed MCP contribution can create a public GitHub issue only with
explicit operator approval of the exact content and a configured authorized
GitHub token. No AI system has canonical ontology write authority; public issue
submission is not acceptance of a scientific claim. A later task proposes making the invitation discoverable in RDF
and annotation metadata; [AI_CONTRIBUTION_IN_RDF_PLAN.md](docs/technical/AI_CONTRIBUTION_IN_RDF_PLAN.md)
is **deferred** and does not authorize changes to protected ontology sources.

**SSTIM** is the open formalized knowledge standard: its specification, RDF
vocabulary, semantic infrastructure, documentation, interoperability work, and
shared identifiers. The **SSTIM ecosystem** is broader: SSTIM, its reference
tooling and community, plus sensory-stimulation applications and initiatives
whether they adopt SSTIM, contribute to or support it, or are related through
documented domain relevance. Its executable reference environment is **SSTIM
Workbench** (formerly presented publicly as BSC Lab), with two integrated layers:

1. **Stimulation layer** — a precision multi-engine audiovisual stimulation application
   (Web Audio API, PixiJS, haptics) that delivers sensory entrainment sessions
   via configurable preset parameter sets.

2. **Knowledge layer** — an RDF knowledge graph browser, annotator, and SPARQL
   query interface for the SSTIM ontology: OWL class hierarchy, SKOS vocabulary,
   SHACL validation shapes, and linked evidence chains.

SSTIM Workbench is non-normative reference software; co-location does not make
its behavior part of the SSTIM specification. Existing BSC/BSC Lab RDF
identities, historical records, `bsclab-*` formats, and provenance remain real
and must not be mechanically renamed. The related commercial application is
**BioSynCare** (separate repository, React Native, closed source). SSTIM
Workbench does **not currently feed** BioSynCare: the documented preset JSON format
is the intended narrow interface, but no Patch Studio→catalog converter or
`dist/presets.json` pipeline exists. A future adapter is optional,
version-pinned, and must not make BioSynCare requirements part of SSTIM or the
native Studio model. Do not conflate the projects.

**Public ecosystem architecture.** BioSynCare adopts and contributes to SSTIM,
participates in the SSTIM ecosystem, and is the center of its own overlapping
application ecosystem. Ecosystem inclusion is relational: it never implies
ownership, affiliation, endorsement, transitive component membership, or
application-wide conformance. The W3C Community Group belongs to the SSTIM
ecosystem and is connected to the BioSynCare application ecosystem through
SSTIM, while remaining independent. Do not confuse this broad relationship
sense with the narrower production-membership record at
`https://w3id.org/sstim/ecosystem/biosyncare` (ADR 0047), in which the Community
Group is not a programme component. The canonical public explanation and
applications/initiatives directory are at `/ecosystem/` inside the Workbench.

**Maintained by:** Renato Fabbri (PhD physics, musical composition, creator of the
`music` Python package on PyPI). Scientific advisor: Juliana Braga de Salles Andrade
(PhD neuroscience, neuroimaging).

**Key documents** — read these before working on any specific layer:
- `docs/concept/SENSORY_STIMULATION.md` — what the domain is
- `docs/concept/SCOPE.md` — what we claim and explicitly do not claim
- `docs/technical/PRESET_FORMAT.md` — the preset data format specification
- `static/ontology/README.md` — OWL/SKOS design decisions
- `docs/ontology/SSTIM_DIRECTIONS.md` — where the model is going and why: SSTIM
  is a universal standard and BioSynCare is one audio-focused application, so
  SSTIM takes that format's hard-won parameter ranges and none of its structure.

## 2. Technology Stack

These decisions are final unless `src/README.md` documents a change. Do not
substitute alternatives without explicit instruction. Rows marked **(planned)**
are chosen but not yet installed — do not describe them as how the app works.

| Layer | Technology | Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build | Vite | 6.x | ESM-native dev, fast HMR, SvelteKit static build |
| UI framework | Svelte 5 | 5.x | Compiler-based, near-vanilla bundle, reactive stores fit SPARQL result rendering |
| RDF parsing/store | N3.js | 1.17+ | Parses Turtle/TriG/N-Quads, in-memory triple store |
| SPARQL engine | Comunica | `@comunica/query-sparql-rdfjs` 3.x | SPARQL 1.1 in browser against N3 store |
| RDF validation | rdf-validate-shacl | 0.5+ | Installed, but used only by tests today (`*.shacl.test.js`, `adr-0027-negative-fixtures.test.mjs`). Browser-side validation is **(planned)** — see §5.4. `make validate` uses pySHACL |
| Graph visualization | Cytoscape.js | 3.28+ | RDF ontology/evidence graph navigation |
| Visual engine (default) | PixiJS | v8.x | **(planned — not installed.)** Auto WebGPU/WebGL, unified renderer API. Visuals today are CSS/DOM in the Patch Studio |
| Audio engine (default) | Vanilla Web Audio API | browser native | Direct AudioContext control, no abstraction overhead |
| Haptic engine (default) | Web Vibration API | browser native | **(planned.)** NullHapticEngine fallback for unsupported platforms; the studio shows a haptic preview only |
| App hosting | GitHub Pages | current | Client-only project site at `/sstim/`; `SSTIM_BASE_PATH` is the one build-time mount setting. Custom hosting remains possible. |
| Ontology artifacts | GitHub Pages | current | Canonical artifacts publish under `/sstim/ontology/`; production w3id.org routes to the W3C-CG project site (cut over 2026-08-27 in perma-id PR #6609). The legacy origin remains a byte-identical dual-publication/rollback surface, including explicit exceptions required by frozen manifests with historical root-absolute paths. |
| Ontology docs | WIDOCO + pyLODE | 1.4.25 / 2.13.2 (flake-pinned) | HTML reference docs generated in `pages.yml`, artifact only, never committed (ADR 0023): WIDOCO (`make ontology-docs` → `/ontology/docs/`) for the OWL core; pyLODE `vocpub` (`make vocab-docs` → `/ontology/docs/vocab/`) for the SKOS vocabulary. Browser target at w3id stays the knowledge browser |
| CSS | Pico.css | current | Semantic HTML-first, no utility class noise |
| PWA / offline | SvelteKit native service worker | built-in | Installable, offline-capable from the same static `dist/`. No `vite-plugin-pwa`. Three binding constraints — see ADR 0009 + `docs/technical/PWA_SERVICE_WORKER.md` |
| Dev toolchain | Nix flake | flakes | First-class: `flake.nix` pins Node, Python+pySHACL, WABT; CI runs inside it. `flake.lock` is the source of truth — regenerate via `nix flake update` |

### Svelte 5 AI tooling setup

Svelte 5 uses **runes syntax** (`$props()`, `$state()`, `$derived()`, `$effect()`,
`onclick`, `{@render children()}`). AI models default to Svelte 4 syntax without
configuration. Always use:

```bash
# Add to MCP configuration
npx @sveltejs/mcp
```

If an AI agent generates Svelte 4 syntax (`export let`, `$:`, `on:click`,
`<slot />`), reject it and regenerate with an explicit runes instruction.
`.cursor/rules/rdf.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/audio-engine.mdc` exist and are
scoped by glob; like the other agent files they summarise and point here rather
than restating, so this file remains the rule source.

### Local dev server

The toolchain is pinned by `flake.nix` and is first-class: CI (build, check,
validate, Pages deploy) runs every command inside `nix develop`. When working in
an environment that has Nix, enter the shell first so your Node/Python/WABT match
CI exactly:

```bash
nix develop            # or `direnv allow` once, then it auto-loads
```

When an AI agent needs to inspect routes, reproduce a UI bug, or run browser
automation, start the Vite dev server from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
make dev
```

`make dev` is the canonical entrypoint. The underlying package script is
`npm run dev`; if custom flags are required, run:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173
```

Use `http://127.0.0.1:4173/` as the local app URL unless the human explicitly
requests a different host or port. Reuse an existing Vite process if one is
already running; do not start duplicate dev servers. For production-build
inspection, use `make preview` on `http://127.0.0.1:4174/`. For documentation-only
or ontology-only edits, a dev server is not required.

---

## 3. Absolute Invariants

**These rules are never violated under any circumstances. No exception, no workaround.**

### 3.1 The engine timing context is the only clock

`engine.getAudioContext().currentTime` is the sole timing authority for all
audio-visual synchronization. Sounding engines return a real `AudioContext`,
whose hardware clock provides sub-millisecond precision (~0.02ms at 48kHz).
The capability-free Silent engine returns the documented monotonic timing
surface instead; it has no audio hardware to synchronize. No caller may create
or mix in a separate wall clock.

```javascript
// CORRECT — always
const timingContext = engine.getAudioContext();
const t = timingContext.currentTime;
oscillatorNode.frequency.setValueAtTime(value, t + 0.1);

// WRONG — never use for AV sync
Date.now()
performance.now()
setTimeout()
setInterval()
new Date()
```

Visual engine frames must read the active engine timing context's `currentTime`
at the start of each `requestAnimationFrame` callback and compute all positions
from it. Never accumulate deltas. Always compute absolute position from that
clock.

### 3.2 AudioWorklet files are never bundled

Files in `static/worklets/` are loaded by `AudioWorkletNode` at runtime via URL.
They run in an isolated audio rendering thread with no access to the main thread
DOM or module system.

```javascript
// CORRECT
await audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('/worklets/bsc-voice.worklet.js');

// WRONG — Vite must never process these
import BscVoiceWorklet from './worklets/bsc-voice.worklet.js';
```

Never import worklet files. Never add them to Vite's module graph. They must remain
plain ES-compatible scripts in `static/worklets/`. The current processors are
`bsc-voice.worklet.js` (JS DSP) and `bsc-voice-wasm.worklet.js` (which loads the
`bsc-osc.wasm` kernel); the ambient `Sample` clips in `static/audio/*.wav` are
likewise plain static assets.

### 3.3 No allocation inside AudioWorkletProcessor.process()

The `process()` callback runs on the audio rendering thread with a ~2.67ms budget
(128 samples at 48kHz). Any allocation (new arrays, closures, object creation) that
triggers garbage collection will cause audio glitches.

```javascript
// CORRECT — pre-allocate outside process()
class BinauralProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this._phase = new Float32Array(2);  // pre-allocated
    this._buf = new Float32Array(128);  // pre-allocated
  }

  process(inputs, outputs) {
    // Use only pre-allocated buffers. No `new`. No spread. No closures.
    const out = outputs[0];
    // ... operate on this._phase, this._buf
    return true;
  }
}
```

### 3.4 Ontology files are not auto-modified

These encode scientific decisions, vocabulary definitions, and legal prior-art
records. They are never modified by an AI agent without an explicit human
instruction in the current session naming the file: "modify [filename]".

```
static/ontology/*.ttl              every manifest-owned module, its shapes,
                                   and its profile entry points
static/ontology/instances/**/*.ttl public reference data
static/ontology/frameworks/**/*.ttl framework vocabularies and their shapes
                                   (BSC's, ADR 0061); outside the manifest
static/ontology/<version>/**       frozen releases — immutable, never edited
docs/technical/BREATHING_MODEL.md
docs/technical/SYMMETRY_SYSTEM.md
docs/technical/MARTIGLI_BINAURAL.md
```

The pattern is deliberate: the modular split (ADR 0043) turned one root file into
many, and a hand-maintained list would have silently unprotected every module
added after it was written. `static/ontology/manifest.json` is the authoritative
inventory. See [ADR 0004](docs/decisions/0004-protected-ontology-files.md).

The three `docs/technical/` files are defensive publications — timestamped prior
art records. Modifying them after their first commit date undermines their legal
function.

### 3.5 Product claims are wellness-framed; the science is described accurately

Two different kinds of text get written here, and one rule was being applied to
both. Read which one you are writing before you write it.

**A claim about what this software will do for the person using it** is
regulated speech. Under MDR 2017/745 the deciding criterion is intended
purpose, so a UI string, a preset description, or store and web copy offering
diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease puts the
software in scope as a medical device. It is not one, and this is a regulatory
requirement rather than a style preference.

**Permitted verbs:** support, promote, facilitate, encourage, help, guide, invite.

**Prohibited in product copy:** treat, cure, fix, eliminate, rewire, correct
pathology, restore diseased function, proven to, clinically proven,
scientifically proven, guaranteed to, eliminates [condition].

**A description of the field, of a technique, or of the evidence is not a
product claim, and is held to accuracy rather than to conservatism.** Sensory
stimulation is used in medicine. Devices that deliver it are regulated as
medical devices, they exist, and more of them should. SSTIM is a standard for
describing that entire field, and a standard that cannot write "treatment"
cannot describe its own subject matter.

The test case is already published: `sstim-v:techElectroconvulsiveTherapy`. ECT
is a psychiatric treatment delivered by a Class III medical device, and its
definition has to say so. `sstim:InterventionalNeuromodulation`,
`sstim:Neurostimulation` and `sstim-v:designPreclinicalExperiment` are the same
case. Softening any of them to avoid a verb on the list above would make the
vocabulary wrong about the world, which is a worse failure than the one the list
exists to prevent.

So the restriction covers UI strings, preset `descEng`/`descIta`/`descPrt`/`descEsp`,
and store and web copy: anything speaking about what a user will get. It does
not cover `skos:definition`, `skos:scopeNote` and other ontology annotations,
evidence assessments, ADRs, `docs/`, or the specification. Those describe what
is true.

Re-read `docs/concept/SCOPE.md` before writing either kind. Its "Three subjects,
three postures" section is what keeps them apart, and the regulatory positioning
that follows it governs the products only.

### 3.6 A claim that something is missing requires a named instrument

**Before writing that anything is absent, undefined, untested, unresolved, or
not done, name the instrument you used and confirm it could see the place the
thing would be.** If you cannot, say the claim is unverified. This is an
invariant because the failure is silent, self-consistent, and expensive: it has
reached an accepted ADR, and it has come within one command of republishing a
live public graph to add a record that was already there.

The rule covers three cases that "check your greps" does not:

1. **Findings you inherit.** A claim in a review document, an ADR, a commit
   message, or `TODO.md` is someone's past measurement, and it decays. Re-measure
   before acting on it. A 2026-08-17 review's central table called four of six
   RDF emitters unverified; two of the six emit no RDF at all, and one of the
   "untested" files was covered by a suite one directory away.
2. **Claims you make with no measurement.** Asserting that a persistent
   identifier resolves because a *related* one does is not a check. `curl` it.
3. **External services.** An eventually-consistent index answers "absent" for a
   thing that exists. Zenodo's search API reported no `0.15.0` DOI for over an
   hour after minting; resolving the concept DOI answered instantly.

**Where SSTIM things actually live.** No single grep sees more than two of these,
and picking the wrong one produces a confident, wrong absence:

| Kind | Lives in | A repo grep sees it? |
|---|---|---|
| Classes, properties, concepts | the 18 manifest-owned modules | yes — but use `docs/ontology/TERM_INDEX.md`, which is generated and CI-checked |
| Public reference data | `static/ontology/instances/**` | yes |
| Released artifacts | `static/ontology/<version>/` | yes, and they are immutable |
| **Real ecosystem agents and relationships** | **the external live-only store** | **no — ADR 0031 keeps them out of git on purpose; only synthetic fixtures are committed** |
| Stakeholder directory (a listing of the field, not records) | `src/ui/ecosystem/stakeholderDirectory.js` | yes — but an entry there says nothing about the live store; ADR 0062 |
| Version DOIs | `void.ttl`, `CITATION.cff`, `src/ui/entrance/releaseMetadata.js`, `CURRENT_STATE.md` | yes, and `make truth-audit` compares them |

For any SSTIM identifier, the executable answer is:

```bash
python3 scripts/locate-iri.py sstim:composedOfTrack
python3 scripts/locate-iri.py https://w3id.org/sstim/organization/aeterni-anima
```

It checks all five places, including the live store, and reports **INCOMPLETE**
rather than "absent" when it cannot reach one — an unreachable instrument must
never read as evidence of absence.

### 3.7 A push reaches both remotes, or it has not happened

This repository publishes to two: `origin`
(`laBioSynCare/laBioSynCare.github.io`), the preserved legacy origin, and
`w3c-cg` (`w3c-cg/sstim`), which serves `w3c-cg.github.io/sstim` and is the
repository that registry records, the W3C CG report and the published `sstim`
and `@sstim/core` packages all name as the source. `git push` updates one of
them, so publishing here is not a one command operation.

```bash
make push     # current branch and its annotated tags to both, each read back
make pull     # fetch both, fast-forward from each, fail if the two disagree
```

**Why this is an invariant and not a habit.** The drift is invisible from the
machine that caused it. The legacy origin keeps answering every URL, CI stays
green, the live site stays current, and nothing local can see that the other
origin is behind. Only an outside reader meets the 404.

It has happened twice, and prose did not stop it: the record of the arrangement
has said "every commit reaches both repositories" since 2026-08-23. The mirror
was 28 commits behind when the CG Draft report was registered, so the report's
own URL answered 404 (`docs/ontology/INBOUND_REFERENCES.md` §2.7), and 6 commits
behind when `sstim` 0.1.0 went to PyPI, which is why that release's
`Project-URL` fields point at the legacy origin (`docs/ecosystem/ADOPTION.md`
§3 C).

Frozen releases are unaffected, and saying so is part of the rule, because it
tells you what the failure actually costs: `w3id.org/sstim` resolves to the
latest frozen snapshot, so a stale mirror cannot stale a published version. What
goes stale is everything an adopter reads, meaning documentation, examples, the
packages' own links, and any page added since.

---

## 4. Preset Format — Critical Rules

Presets are the core catalog data objects. The canonical specification is
`docs/technical/PRESET_FORMAT.md`. These rules apply to any code that
reads, writes, validates, or generates presets.

> **Do not confuse two distinct models.** This section governs the **preset
> catalog JSON** (`header` + `voices`, voice types `Binaural` / `Martigli` /
> `Martigli-Binaural` / `Symmetry`) shared with BioSynCare. The **Patch Studio**
> (`src/ui/creator/`) is a separate, live authoring model tagged
> `model: "patch-studio-model-3"` with its own track types (`IsochronicTone`,
> `BinauralBeat`, `Carrier`, `Noise`, `Drone`, `Sample`, …). Genuine model-1
> and model-2 documents remain importable. New exports must never carry newer
> fields under an older model tag — see
> `docs/technical/PATCH_STUDIO.md`. The rules in §4 do not apply to patch drafts.

### 4.1 Voice type names

Always written exactly as shown. Case-sensitive. Never abbreviated.

| Correct | Wrong |
|---|---|
| `"Binaural"` | `"binaural"`, `"BINAURAL"`, `"bin"` |
| `"Martigli"` | `"martigli"`, `"breathing"`, `"breath"` |
| `"Martigli-Binaural"` | `"MartigliB"`, `"MB"`, `"martigli-binaural"` |
| `"Symmetry"` | `"symmetry"`, `"sym"`, `"isochronic"` |

### 4.2 Waveform fields are always numeric zero

```json
// CORRECT
"waveformL": 0,
"waveformR": 0,
"waveformM": 0,
"waveform": 0

// WRONG — strings are invalid
"waveformL": "sine",
"waveform": "0"
```

### 4.3 Frequency band values (SKOS concept notations)

Always lowercase. These are the only valid values for `header.targetBand`. They
are each band concept's `skos:notation`, not its local name, which is camelCase:
`low-alpha` is the notation of `sstim-v:lowAlpha`, `alpha-10` of `sstim-v:alpha10`.

```
Primary:   delta, theta, alpha, smr, beta, gamma
Sub-bands: low-delta, high-delta, low-theta, high-theta,
           low-alpha, high-alpha, low-beta, mid-beta, high-beta
Singles:   alpha-10, gamma-40
```

### 4.4 Group names

Always capitalized. Exactly one of: `Heal`, `Support`, `Perform`, `Indulge`, `Transcend`.

### 4.5 Breathing constraint

At most **one** voice per preset may have `isOn: true`. If `isOn: true`, `mp0`
must be ≥ 3 (values below 3s are tremolo, not breathing guidance). `hasBreathGuide`
in the header must be `true` if and only if exactly one voice has `isOn: true`.

### 4.6 Volume defaults and limits

```javascript
// Defaults by voice type
Martigli / Martigli-Binaural: 0.25
Binaural:                      0.18
Symmetry:                      0.13

// Hard limits
iniVolume > 0.30  →  requires explicit rationale in code comment
iniVolume = 1.0   →  invalid; do not generate
```

### 4.7 Symmetry timing — use engine model, not deprecated abstraction

The note/pulse rate is `nnotes / d` Hz. The onset interval is `noteSep = d / nnotes`.
The maximum supported rate is 50 Hz (`noteSep` ≥ 20ms). When `noctaves = 0`, the
voice is a traditional isochronic pulse train — validate by pulse rate target, not
by melodic note duration rules.

```javascript
// CORRECT: 10 Hz isochronic
{ noctaves: 0, nnotes: 10, d: 1.0 }    // 10/1.0 = 10 Hz ✓
{ noctaves: 0, nnotes: 20, d: 2.0 }    // 20/2.0 = 10 Hz ✓

// CORRECT: 40 Hz isochronic
{ noctaves: 0, nnotes: 8,  d: 0.2 }    // 8/0.2 = 40 Hz ✓
{ noctaves: 0, nnotes: 20, d: 0.5 }    // 20/0.5 = 40 Hz ✓

// WRONG: exceeds 50 Hz limit
{ noctaves: 0, nnotes: 3,  d: 0.05 }   // 3/0.05 = 60 Hz ✗
```

---

## 5. RDF/Ontology — Critical Rules

### 5.1 Namespace declarations

All RDF work uses namespaces defined in `src/rdf/namespaces.js`. Never hardcode
namespace strings inline. Import from that file.

```javascript
// CORRECT
import { SSTIM, SSTIM_V, OWL, SKOS, RDF, RDFS, XSD } from '../rdf/namespaces.js';

// WRONG — hardcoded strings
const band = 'https://w3id.org/sstim#FrequencyBand';
```

The canonical BSC namespace prefixes:

```turtle
@prefix sstim:    <https://w3id.org/sstim#> .
@prefix sstim-v:  <https://w3id.org/sstim/vocab#> .
@prefix sstim-sh:   <https://w3id.org/sstim/shapes#> .
@prefix bsc-fw:   <https://w3id.org/sstim/framework/bsc/> .
@prefix bsc-v:    <https://w3id.org/sstim/framework/bsc/vocab#> .
@prefix bsc-sh:   <https://w3id.org/sstim/framework/bsc/shapes#> .
@prefix bsclab:   <https://w3id.org/sstim/implementation/bsclab/> .
@prefix biosyncare: <https://w3id.org/sstim/implementation/biosyncare/> .
```

**Namespace convention — one registered SSTIM namespace, scoped by role.**

- `https://w3id.org/sstim` (`/sstim#`, `/sstim/vocab#`, `/sstim/shapes#`) — the
  **ontology**: OWL classes and properties, SKOS vocabulary concepts, SHACL
  shapes. This is the reusable, citable scientific artifact. Every `.ttl` file
  in `static/ontology/` declares its prefixes here.
- `https://w3id.org/sstim/framework/bsc` — the **BSC framework**: techniques,
  composition rules, evidence rules, grouping logic, and design principles.
  Its own vocabulary (`bsc-v:`, the catalog's voice classes, preset groups and
  Martigli parameters) and shapes (`bsc-sh:`) live in
  `static/ontology/frameworks/bsc/`, outside the manifest, so no SSTIM release
  carries them. A term belongs in the SSTIM namespaces only if its meaning holds
  without any one framework, product, catalog format or implementation
  ([ADR 0061](docs/decisions/0061-universal-namespaces-carry-no-framework-structure.md)).
- `https://w3id.org/sstim/implementation/biosyncare` — the commercial
  **BioSynCare** implementation and catalog.
- `https://w3id.org/sstim/implementation/bsclab` — the open **BSC Lab**
  reference implementation, public seeds, and knowledge-browser data.

Implementation data uses implementation-scoped subpaths:
`/preset/{id}`, `/session/{id}`, `/annotation/{id}`, and `/evidence/{id}`.

Never publish a BSC preset or session in the reusable ontology term space
(`sstim#`, `sstim/vocab#`, `sstim/shapes#`); never declare an OWL class or
SKOS concept under an implementation path. BSC itself is a framework, not a
protocol, preset, or software app. See
`docs/decisions/0007-framework-protocol-implementation.md`.

### 5.2 Dual-typing pattern for vocabulary concepts

SKOS concepts in `sstim-vocab.ttl` are dual-typed: they are both `skos:Concept` and
instances of the relevant OWL class. This is intentional (Pattern 2 design decision
documented in `static/ontology/README.md`). Do not "fix" this by removing either type.

```turtle
# CORRECT — dual-typed individual
sstim-v:alpha a skos:Concept, sstim:FrequencyBand ;
    skos:prefLabel "Alpha"@en, "Alfa"@it, "Alfa"@pt, "Alfa"@es .

# WRONG — removing the OWL class membership breaks SHACL validation
sstim-v:alpha a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel "Alpha"@en .
```

### 5.3 SPARQL query patterns

Always use `src/rdf/query.js` for SPARQL execution. The loader keeps every
source in its own named graph, and `query.js` reads a pattern outside `GRAPH`
against the merge of the authoritative ones: every ontology module and every
committed public instance source, each triple once. Annotation graphs and the
live ecosystem projection are reachable only through `GRAPH` (GB-04, §5.5).
`src/rdf/defaultGraph.test.js` runs the two queries below from this file and
checks their row counts. Standard patterns:

```javascript
// Get all presets with their target bands and any evidence tier.
// Evidence tiers live on sstim:EvidenceAssessmentClaim (ADR 0027; the concrete
// evidence-bearing subtype of sstim:EvidenceClaim), linked to its subject via
// sstim:evaluatesSubject — the neutral relation that replaced the directionally
// misleading sstim:supportsRelation (deprecated; SSTIM's own data stopped
// asserting it in 0.19.0). Tiers
// are not on the preset; preset rdfs:labels carry no language tag.
const PRESET_QUERY = `
PREFIX sstim: <https://w3id.org/sstim#>
PREFIX sstim-v: <https://w3id.org/sstim/vocab#>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?preset ?label ?tier ?band ?bandLabel WHERE {
  ?preset a sstim:Preset ;
          rdfs:label ?label ;
          sstim:targetsFrequencyBand ?band .
  ?band skos:prefLabel ?bandLabel .
  OPTIONAL {
    ?claim a sstim:EvidenceAssessmentClaim ;
           sstim:evaluatesSubject ?preset ;
           sstim:hasEvidenceTier ?tier .
  }
  FILTER(LANG(?bandLabel) = "en")
}
ORDER BY ?tier`;

// SKOS hierarchy traversal — all sub-bands of alpha
const SUBBANDS_QUERY = `
PREFIX sstim-v: <https://w3id.org/sstim/vocab#>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>

SELECT ?band WHERE {
  sstim-v:alpha skos:narrower* ?band .
}`;
```

### 5.4 SHACL validation before any preset export

Never export RDF that has not been validated against the applicable shape
package. Log the violations and return nothing rather than emitting a
non-conformant graph.

A browser-side `src/rdf/validate.js` (rdf-validate-shacl) is **planned and does
not exist yet** — do not import it. Today validation runs under `make validate`
via pySHACL, and the tests that assert conformance of generated graphs live
beside their producers (for example `src/ui/field/exposureProfile.shacl.test.js`
and `src/portability/sessionPackage.test.js`). Follow that pattern for any new
RDF-emitting surface.

### 5.5 Annotations use named graphs

Annotation data is stored in named graphs, never in the default graph. The default
graph contains only authoritative ontology data. This separation is enforced in
`src/rdf/annotations/AnnotationStore.js`.

```javascript
// CORRECT — annotation in named graph
const annotationGraph = namedNode(`https://w3id.org/sstim/implementation/bsclab/annotation/${userId}`);
store.addQuad(subject, predicate, object, annotationGraph);

// WRONG — annotation in default graph pollutes authoritative data
store.addTriple(subject, predicate, object);
```

## 6. Stimulation Engine Architecture

The target architecture is in `docs/technical/AUDIO_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and
`src/core/README.md`. **As built today:** four selectable `IAudioEngine`
implementations (Vanilla Web Audio, AudioWorklet, AudioWorklet+WASM, Null) chosen
in Settings and applied on next playback — see `src/engines/README.md` and
`docs/technical/PATCH_STUDIO.md`. The `core/` orchestrator + Worker scheduler and
the `visual/`/`haptic/` engines are still planned. Critical points for any code
touching the engine:

### 6.1 Three-clock architecture — never collapse it

The system uses three synchronized clocks with distinct roles:

```
Engine timing authority AudioContext.currentTime  — sounding engines, sub-ms precision
                        Silent monotonic context   — visual/timing-only sessions
Scheduling clock        Web Worker + setInterval  — 25ms ticks, immune to main-thread jank
Rendering clock         requestAnimationFrame     — visual updates, reads engine clock
```

For sounding engines, the Worker scheduler reads `AudioContext.currentTime`,
schedules events 100ms ahead, and posts timing state to the main thread. The rAF
loop always reads the active engine's timing context and renders. Never merge
these clocks. Never schedule audio events from rAF.

### 6.2 Engine interface contract

All audio engines implement `src/engines/audio/IAudioEngine.js`. New audio
engines are added via the registry/factory in
`src/engines/audio/audioEngines.js` (so they appear in Settings and inherit
capability-based fallback). The visual and haptic interfaces
(`engines/visual/IVisualEngine.js`, `engines/haptic/IHapticEngine.js`) are
planned. When adding an implementation, implement the full interface and call
only interface methods from callers — never engine-specific methods.

### 6.3 Engine capability detection

```javascript
// CORRECT — always check capabilities before using features
const caps = audioEngine.getCapabilities();
if (caps.supportsWasm) {
  // use WASM DSP path
} else {
  // fall back to vanilla Web Audio
}

// WRONG — assuming capability
audioEngine.loadWasmModule(url); // may throw on unsupported engine
```

### 6.4 Haptic timing offset

The Vibration API and Web Audio API use different clocks with no shared reference.
Always offset haptic events by `audioContext.outputLatency`:

```javascript
const hapticDelay = audioContext.outputLatency * 1000; // convert to ms
setTimeout(() => hapticEngine.vibrate(pattern), hapticDelay);
```

iOS Safari does not support `navigator.vibrate()`. `NullHapticEngine` handles this
silently. Never let a missing haptic engine throw or log errors to the user.

## 7. Project Structure Quick Reference

Directory listings drift; these indexes do not, because each is maintained where
the thing lives:

| For | Read |
|---|---|
| Documentation map | [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) |
| Architecture decisions | [`docs/decisions/README.md`](docs/decisions/README.md) |
| Application architecture | [`src/README.md`](src/README.md) |
| Ontology sources and design | [`static/ontology/README.md`](static/ontology/README.md) |
| Live ontology module inventory | `static/ontology/manifest.json` (machine-readable, authoritative) |
| **Does SSTIM already have this term?** | [`docs/ontology/TERM_INDEX.md`](docs/ontology/TERM_INDEX.md) — generated, CI-checked. **Grep it before saying a term is missing.** 18 modules is more than anyone searches reliably by hand |
| Tracked work | [`TODO.md`](TODO.md), [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) |

The paths that carry invariants, and are therefore worth naming here:

```
static/worklets/       AudioWorklet processors — NEVER bundled by Vite (§3.2)
  bsc-voice.worklet.js       unified voice processor (JS DSP)
  bsc-voice-wasm.worklet.js  unified voice processor (WASM oscillator)
  bsc-osc.wat / .wasm        hand-written sine-LUT kernel + source
static/audio/          ambient Sample clips (CC0) — runtime-cached, never precached (§9)
static/ontology/       Turtle served same-origin (copied to dist/); §3.4 protects it
static/_headers        COOP/COEP/CORP for a future custom host; GitHub Pages ignores it
src/rdf/namespaces.js  the only place an ontology IRI may be written (§5.1)
src/service-worker.js  three binding constraints — see §9 and ADR 0009
static/ontology/frameworks/bsc/  BSC framework vocabulary + shapes; not SSTIM,
                       in no profile or snapshot (ADR 0061, §3.4 protects it)
static/schemas/        preset.schema.json + session.schema.json — SSTIM's own
                       contracts, checked by `make preset-contract` and
                       `make session-contract`. Not under `schemas/`.
```

## 8. What You Must Not Do

These are not style preferences. They are constraints derived from scientific,
legal, regulatory, or architectural requirements.

| Action | Reason |
|---|---|
| Modify BSC instance TTL under `static/ontology/instances/` without explicit instruction | Vocabulary changes require scientific review |
| Modify the three defensive publication files | They are timestamped prior art records |
| Use `Date.now()` or `setTimeout()` for AV sync outside the Silent engine's encapsulated clock | Only the active engine timing context is authoritative |
| Bundle files in `static/worklets/` | AudioWorklets must load as plain static scripts |
| Allocate inside `AudioWorkletProcessor.process()` | GC in the audio thread causes glitches |
| Write a treatment or diagnostic claim **in product copy** | Regulatory compliance (§3.5). Describing a clinical technique accurately in an ontology definition or in `docs/` is required, not prohibited |
| Use Svelte 4 syntax (`export let`, `$:`, `on:click`) | This project uses Svelte 5 runes only |
| Add ontology IRIs as hardcoded strings | Use `src/rdf/namespaces.js` exclusively |
| Write preset group names in lowercase | `Heal`, `Support`, `Perform`, `Indulge`, `Transcend` — always capitalized |
| Write voice type names as anything other than the exact enum | `"Binaural"`, `"Martigli"`, `"Martigli-Binaural"`, `"Symmetry"` |
| Merge annotation data into the default RDF graph | Annotations live in named graphs only |
| Call engine-specific methods from `StimulationOrchestrator` | Only interface methods; use capability detection |
| Set `iniVolume: 1.0` in any preset | Hard upper limit; use ≤ 0.30 by default |
| Set `isOn: true` on more than one voice per preset | Exactly one voice carries the breathing reference |
| Auto-reload the page from the service worker on update | Would kill an in-progress session; reload only on explicit user click (ADR 0009, Trap 1) |
| Let the service worker intercept cross-origin requests | Breaks Firebase auth / Google sign-in; same-origin only (ADR 0009, Trap 2) |
| Push to one remote and stop | `w3c-cg/sstim` is the source registry records and published packages name; a stale mirror 404s while `origin` still answers (§3.7). Use `make push` |

## 9. Known Pitfalls

**Svelte 5 runes syntax confusion.** AI models default to Svelte 4 without the MCP
server configured. Check every generated Svelte component for `export let` or `$:`
— both are Svelte 4 and will cause compilation errors in Svelte 5.

**PixiJS v8 breaking changes from v7.** PixiJS v8 is a full rewrite. v7 examples
and tutorials produce broken code in v8. The import path changed; the renderer init
changed; `PIXI.Application` async init changed. Always verify against v8
documentation at `pixijs.com/8.x/`.

**SharedArrayBuffer requires COOP/COEP headers.** WASM audio with threading and
ring buffers requires `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`. GitHub Pages cannot serve these
headers. That is acceptable while BSC Lab is a client-only knowledge browser;
move runtime hosting to Netlify or another custom-header host before shipping
threaded WASM audio or any feature that depends on `SharedArrayBuffer`.

**COEP blocks cross-origin RDF fetches.** `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
means every resource the app loads must be same-origin or carry
`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`. The ontology `.ttl` files are
therefore bundled as static assets in `static/ontology/` and served from the same
origin as the app. If runtime hosting moves away from GitHub Pages, keep the
same-source-file pattern: the app origin serves runtime copies, and GitHub Pages
continues to serve the citable/stable copies used by w3id redirects.

**Comunica bundle size.** `@comunica/query-sparql` is ~500KB+ gzipped. Use dynamic
import to lazy-load it only when the SPARQL interface is opened, not at app startup.

**Service worker — three binding constraints.** The PWA service worker
(`src/service-worker.js`, spec in `docs/technical/PWA_SERVICE_WORKER.md`, ADR
0009) is networking/caching only and never touches the audio clock, but three
rules are non-negotiable: (1) **never auto-reload** — the worker must not call
`skipWaiting()` on its own; updates wait and reload only on an explicit user
click, or an in-progress stimulation session is killed mid-stream; (2) **never
intercept cross-origin** — the `fetch` handler returns early for any
`url.origin !== self.location.origin`, which is what keeps Firebase auth/Firestore
and Google sign-in working; (3) **never eagerly precache the heavy assets** — the
ambient `static/audio/*.wav` (~2.8 MB) and ontology `.ttl` are runtime-cached on
first use, not precached. Do not "simplify" any of these away.

**Service worker is production-only.** `kit.serviceWorker.register = false`; the
worker is registered manually in `src/ui/pwa/ServiceWorkerUpdate.svelte` under
`!dev`. Never enable it in `make dev` — a precaching worker serves stale assets
and fights HMR. If you see stale output during development, check that no worker
is registered (DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister).

**iOS Safari vibration.** `navigator.vibrate` returns `undefined` on iOS Safari,
not `false`. The capability check must use `typeof navigator.vibrate === 'function'`,
not a truthy check.

**AudioContext autoplay policy.** Browsers block `AudioContext.resume()`
until a user gesture. The session player must call `audioContext.resume()` inside
a click/touch event handler, not at module load time.

**Cytoscape.js and Comunica sequential loading.** Both libraries are heavy.
Do not load them at startup. Load Cytoscape when the graph view is first opened;
load Comunica when the SPARQL interface is first opened.

**`await` does not let the browser paint.** Awaiting a promise drains the
microtask queue and resumes on the *same* task, so a fully `async` pipeline can
hold the main thread for seconds while every spinner on the page sits frozen —
which is exactly what the graph loader did. A loading indicator that must stay
alive needs two things: real yields between the phases
(`src/ui/loading/renderYield.js`, or `await` a callback the caller supplies, as
`buildGraphElements` does), and animation of **transform/opacity only** so the
compositor keeps it moving through whatever block remains. Never assume an
`async` function is non-blocking.

**Turtle serialization in N3.js.** `N3.Writer` requires explicit prefix registration
before writing. Prefixes not registered in the writer produce full IRIs in output.
Always initialize the writer with the full prefix map from `src/rdf/namespaces.js`.

**Vite and AudioWorklet static paths.** In development, Vite serves `static/`
at the root. In production builds, the same path applies. Use a relative path from
the app root: `/worklets/bsc-voice.worklet.js`. Never use `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`
for worklet files — that triggers Vite's module bundling.

---

## 10. Testing Requirements

Before any PR or commit touching `static/ontology/`, run `make validate`. It is
the same gate CI runs, and it covers far more than syntax: SHACL over the
applicable profile closures and every public instance, the manifest contract,
the quality audit, HermiT via ROBOT, SPARQL competency queries, export round
trips, the w3id route contract, `make truth-audit`, and `make release-dryrun`.

For application changes, `make test` (Vitest, beside the source) and `make check`
(SvelteKit sync + svelte-check).

`make preset-contract` is the preset gate and it exists: it holds
`static/schemas/preset.schema.json`, `sstim-shapes.ttl` and the ranges in
`PRESET_FORMAT.md` to the same numbers, and rejects schema, cross-field and RDF
adversarial cases. `ajv` and `ajv-formats` are installed and used from it.
`make session-contract` does the equivalent for `session.schema.json`.

**Planned and not yet present:** a dedicated `tests/` subtree, and
`hooks/pre-commit`. When the hook lands it should run the local validation
mirror automatically — fix violations rather than passing `--no-verify`.

---

## 11. Relationship to BioSynCare

BioSynCare is the commercial application (React Native, separate repository).
SSTIM Workbench is SSTIM's non-normative open reference environment; BSC Lab is
its preserved historical public identity and remains in stable records and IRIs.

The intended interface between them is the documented preset JSON format. The
converter, JSON Schema, `dist/presets.json` export, and consumer contract are
planned and **not present**. If the optional adapter is built, it must target a
named catalog version, report unsupported/lossy mappings, validate before
exchange, and coordinate schema changes with the BioSynCare repository. See
`docs/ecosystem/PATCH_STUDIO_CONFORMANCE_AND_NEUTRALITY.md`.

SSTIM Workbench code does not import from BioSynCare. BioSynCare code does not
import from SSTIM Workbench. Any future exchange is validated preset JSON
through the explicit adapter—not code, RDF dependencies, private catalog data,
or backend logic.

Do not add BioSynCare-specific logic to SSTIM Workbench's native model, runtime,
SSTIM terms, or generic UI. If approved, product-specific conversion is confined
to the optional adapter boundary; private acceptance/publication logic remains
in BioSynCare. Do not add SSTIM Workbench RDF dependencies to BioSynCare.

## 12. Updating This File

This file is maintained by Renato Fabbri. If a project decision changes (new
library version, new architectural constraint, new invariant), update this file
in the same commit that implements the change. AI agents should propose updates
to this file when they identify missing context that would have prevented a mistake.
