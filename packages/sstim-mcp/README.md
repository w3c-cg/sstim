# SSTIM MCP: senses, stimuli, perception and research

**Status:** source version 0.3.0 adds an explicitly authorized, GitHub-backed
contribution workflow to the read-only knowledge tools. **The published npm
version is still 0.2.0** until the maintainer performs npm publication.
Use the GitHub checkout to test 0.3.0 contribution features before release.
The new code continues to support the **current MCP
`2026-07-28` stateless protocol** and legacy initialization-based clients
(`2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, `2024-11-05`).

The adapter retrieves frozen SSTIM release data from the
[Concept Reference API](../../docs/technical/CONCEPT_REFERENCE_API.md). It is
not an ontology write interface or hosted remote MCP endpoint.
The four knowledge tools remain available without credentials.
Four additional proposal tools can draft suggestions, browse GitHub review issues,
and, **only when an authorized operator has configured an Issues-write token and
approved the exact public content**, submit a GitHub issue for review.
No tool changes canonical RDF or accepts scientific assertions as established.

## Distribution and authorship

**Primary author and responsible project:** the
[SSTIM W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sstim/).
The canonical source is [w3c-cg/sstim](https://github.com/w3c-cg/sstim).

**Acknowledgement:** [BioSynCare](https://biosyncare.com), for its
contributions to and support of SSTIM's wider ecosystem. BioSynCare is not
the authority behind the open SSTIM vocabulary.

Community Group work is not a W3C Recommendation or a W3C-endorsed product.

### Install from npm (published)

**`@sstim/mcp@0.2.0` is published and has been successfully executed from
npm.** It is listed as `io.github.w3c-cg/sstim` in the official
[MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/), registered by
[the canonical W3C Community Group repository via OIDC](https://github.com/w3c-cg/sstim/actions/runs/38037758861).

With Node.js 20+ and a compatible stdio MCP client, set **command** `npx`
and **arguments** `["--yes", "@sstim/mcp@0.2.0"]`. The server needs no
checkout or API token. For a smoke test, run it outside
`packages/sstim-mcp/`: npm may resolve the local package there instead of
the published executable.

```bash
cd /tmp
npx --yes @sstim/mcp@0.2.0
```

The command waits for protocol messages; silence is expected until the
MCP client sends them. Pin the exact npm version for reproducibility.
Run `node packages/sstim-mcp/server.mjs` from a checkout only for development.

[Distribution and directory-listing status](../../docs/ecosystem/MCP_DISTRIBUTION.md).
The npm `0.2.0` tarball is immutable; subsequent repository documentation
edits are reflected in npm's package README only with a future release.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ on the machine where the AI client runs.
- SSTIM checkout **only if developing the server**. It is not needed for the published npm package.
- Network access to the read-only reference API (default below).
- An AI client with support for local stdio MCP servers.

For each **local-checkout** example below, **replace**
`/absolute/path/to/sstim/packages/sstim-mcp/server.mjs` with the actual **absolute
path** to this file. On Windows, use a path like
`C:/Users/you/sstim/packages/sstim-mcp/server.mjs` and ensure `node` is in
the launching application's `PATH`.

The server is launched by the AI client. Running it manually will appear idle
because it waits for JSON-RPC messages on stdin. It must not emit human-readable
logs to stdout.

## What can an AI assistant do with SSTIM MCP?

For a hands-on tutorial with **eight concrete AI prompts**, prerequisites,
tool usage and limits, see the
[**SSTIM MCP manual chapter**](https://w3c-cg.github.io/sstim/manual/mcp/)
and the [MCP examples cookbook](../../docs/manual/MCP_COOKBOOK.md).

Here are examples for users of Codex, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor,
Gemini and compatible Neovim plugins. Each task combines an AI assistant's
ordinary reasoning and project access with *read-only released SSTIM data*:

| Task | What to ask for | What SSTIM MCP contributes |
|---|---|---|
| Code/data schema alignment | "Inspect my session JSON and map frequency, technique, channels and session fields to SSTIM" | Canonical term IRIs and module/release provenance; **not** an automatically validated mapping |
| Research terminology review | "Compare meanings of binaural and isochronous techniques without conflating stimulation with EEG bands" | Definitions and related concept links |
| Version migration | "Retrieve this exact IRI in 0.18.0 and 0.19.0; report asserted differences" | Version-pinned details, deprecation and mappings |
| Cross-ontology interoperability | "List external alignments for this term, including the precise SKOS relation" | Mapped external IRIs and relation strengths |
| Codebase audit | "Find fields in my code matching published SSTIM properties; flag unknown ones" | Stable identifiers; human review of inferred matches |
| Write scientific documentation | "Explain these terms with source references; distinguish evidence from labels" | Released definitions, source module and hashes |
| Correct the standard | "Find this term or gap and prepare a link for me to submit a correction" | A user-reviewed Contribution Bridge link, **not a submission** |
| Repeatable research | "Use only release 0.19.0 for all SSTIM terms cited in this protocol" | Release-qualified records for reproducibility |

These four MCP tools do **not** perform automatic SHACL validation,
execute a stimulation protocol, diagnose anything, or modify the ontology.
Use [Python sstim](https://pypi.org/project/sstim/) or
[JavaScript @sstim/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sstim/core)
for data validation, and use the Workbench to explore or author reference
patches.

## Contribution workflow in source version 0.3.0

The new `sstim_draft_contribution` tool builds a structured, unreviewed issue
proposal, with an explicit epistemic status. `sstim_list_contributions` and
`sstim_get_contribution` retrieve public issue records and their actual state.
`sstim_submit_contribution` creates a **public GitHub Issue**, but only if
`SSTIM_GITHUB_TOKEN` is configured with appropriate GitHub Issues write access
and `approvedForPublicSubmission: true` is supplied after the operator reviews
the exact proposal. A local cooldown and fingerprint scan reduce accidental
duplicates. This is not an unattended permission to submit private material.

Never put the token in a plugin manifest or conversation. Use the host's
credential or environment management; no GitHub credential is bundled.
Contributions are not automatically accepted; a closed GitHub issue is not
necessarily an accepted scientific assertion.

Supported proposal kinds: correction, missing knowledge, scientific evidence,
interoperability, research need and other. Relevant subjects may include
sensory transduction, perception, sound or music-based practices, neuroscience,
creative work and technological applications. SSTIM is not a comprehensive
encyclopedia of these areas; gaps are valid reports. Sources are
contributor-supplied and must be independently assessed.

This version is **not yet on npm**: the installation examples below continue to
target the verifiably published `@sstim/mcp@0.2.0` and therefore expose only the
four read-only tools until a future npm release.

## Four tools in the currently published npm version

| Tool | Result |
|---|---|
| `sstim_list_releases` | Supported frozen releases and latest available version |
| `sstim_search_concepts` | Search terms by IRI/CURIE, labels, alternatives or definition |
| `sstim_get_concept` | Retrieve exact term, definitions, declared relationships, source provenance |
| `sstim_prepare_feedback` | User-facing Contribution Bridge link; nothing is submitted |

All four tools are **read-only**. The feedback tool generates only a link with
the selected public concept ID and label, without copying conversation text.
The user reviews any issue and decides whether to publish it. No writes to
SSTIM occur through these tools.

## Configure your software

Choose **one** configuration appropriate to the AI client in use. They are
not interchangeable. Sample files are in [`examples/`](examples/).

### 1. VS Code: GitHub Copilot Chat (Agent mode)

Create or update `.vscode/mcp.json` in **your project** using the
[`examples/vscode.mcp.json`](examples/vscode.mcp.json) contents:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sstim": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "@sstim/mcp@0.2.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

In VS Code run **MCP: List Servers** (or use MCP commands in the Command
Palette), start `sstim`, then open **GitHub Copilot Chat → Agent mode** and
enable the SSTIM tools in the tool picker.

This is VS Code's `servers` format, **not** the `mcpServers` format used by
Cursor and Gemini. VS Code can also use a portable project-root `.mcp.json`,
which has different keys; see its
[official MCP setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/mcp-servers).

### 2. VS Code: OpenAI Codex extension / Codex CLI

Codex's IDE extension and CLI share `~/.codex/config.toml` (or supported
project-scoped `.codex/config.toml`). Append the contents of
[`examples/codex.config.toml`](examples/codex.config.toml):

```toml
[mcp_servers.sstim]
command = "npx"
args = ["--yes", "@sstim/mcp@0.2.0"]
```

Or configure the server via the Codex IDE extension:
**Settings → MCP servers → Add server → STDIO**. Restart the extension if
prompted. In the CLI, `codex mcp list` can show the configured servers.
This configuration is separate from `.vscode/mcp.json` for Copilot Chat.

Reference: [Codex MCP configuration](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp).

### 3. VS Code: Claude Code extension / Claude Code CLI

Run in a terminal (using the same Claude Code installation as your extension):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user sstim -- npx --yes @sstim/mcp@0.2.0
claude mcp get sstim
```

Then open Claude Code (CLI or VS Code extension) and check the **/mcp** menu
to confirm the server is connected and tools are visible. The `--` separator
is important: arguments after it belong to `npx`, not to Claude's CLI.
For a shared project installation instead of a personal user installation,
consult the project's `.mcp.json` and approval rules.

Reference: [Claude Code MCP setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp).

### 4. Gemini CLI (including inside VS Code's terminal)

Add to your user `~/.gemini/settings.json` or project
`.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sstim": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "@sstim/mcp@0.2.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [`examples/gemini.settings.json`](examples/gemini.settings.json).
Alternatively use:

```bash
gemini mcp add -s user sstim npx --yes @sstim/mcp@0.2.0
```

Open Gemini CLI and use **/mcp** to inspect connectivity and exposed tools.

**Gemini CLI is not the same product as the Gemini Code Assist VS Code
extension.** This configuration applies to the CLI; support for an extension
must be verified against that extension's own settings.
Reference: [Gemini CLI MCP](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md).

### 5. Cursor

Create a project `.cursor/mcp.json`, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` globally,
with the contents of [`examples/cursor.mcp.json`](examples/cursor.mcp.json):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sstim": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "@sstim/mcp@0.2.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

Open **Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP** and verify the server is connected.
Ask Cursor Agent to use `sstim_search_concepts`.

Reference: [Cursor MCP documentation](https://prod.cursor.com/docs/mcp).

### 6. Neovim with CodeCompanion.nvim

Neovim does not supply an AI/MCP client merely by being installed. If you use
[CodeCompanion.nvim](https://codecompanion.olimorris.dev/configuration/mcp),
add this to its setup (or integrate the `mcp` table into existing config):

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  mcp = {
    servers = {
      sstim = {
        cmd = { "npx", "--yes", "@sstim/mcp@0.2.0" },
      },
    },
    opts = {
      default_servers = { "sstim" },
    },
  },
})
```

See [`examples/neovim-codecompanion.lua`](examples/neovim-codecompanion.lua).
Open a CodeCompanion chat and access MCP tools using the `@mcp:` tool group
or the `/mcp` picker, depending on your CodeCompanion version. The plugin's
MCP client currently supports the older `2025-11-25` handshake, which this
server continues to accept.

For **classic Vim**, no built-in MCP client is assumed. You can use the Claude
Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI configuration above in a terminal inside or outside
Vim; do not paste Neovim Lua into a traditional `.vimrc`.

## Verify the installation

After configuring your chosen client, ask:

> Use the SSTIM MCP tools to list the current released version, search for
> “binaural”, and explain one matched concept using its canonical IRI and
> source provenance. Compare the results for v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 if applicable.

The search tools may be automatically chosen by the agent, but whether a tool
is called depends on client settings and model behavior. You can also inspect
the tool inventory in your host's MCP panel.

For tests inside this repository:

```bash
npm test -- --run packages/sstim-mcp/mcp.test.mjs
npm run check
npm run build
```

The tests exercise mocked API data, legacy and modern MCP handshakes, stdio
framing, and editor-config example syntax. They do not certify interoperability
with every named editor release.

## Protocol versions and constraints

`2026-07-28` is the current MCP protocol revision. Unlike
`2025-11-25`, which negotiates a process-scoped session via
`initialize` / `notifications/initialized`, the new revision uses
**per-request** metadata. This server implements both paths:

- **Modern clients:** `server/discover` advertises `2026-07-28`, tools are
  usable without `initialize`, and every request carries
  `params._meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion"]` and
  `params._meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities"]`.
  Results declare `resultType: "complete"` and server identity metadata.
- **Older clients:** continue using the legacy `initialize` handshake and
  legacy response structure. Supporting this version remains important for
  real installed clients, including some Neovim plugins.

The modern revision does **not** mean the server must be remote: stdio remains
a defined transport. There is currently **no Streamable HTTP endpoint** for
SSTIM MCP; remote ChatGPT connectors would require a separate deployment.

Protocol references:
[MCP 2026-07-28 versioning](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/versioning),
[stdio transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/transports/stdio),
[discovery](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/docs/specification/2026-07-28/server/discover.mdx).

The latest frozen release comes from API discovery, not from a hard-coded
runtime constant. At the time of this update it is **v0.19.0**; the separately
maintained development line is **v0.20.0-dev**. For repeatable research use an
explicit frozen release in tool arguments.

**Operational limits:** read-only ontology catalog; up to 20 search results;
no hosted `?q=` search; no live ontology inference,
adjudication of scientific disputes, or guaranteed clinical meaning.
The default reference URL is
`https://w3c-cg.github.io/sstim/api/v1/`.
An operator can override it with `SSTIM_MCP_API_BASE`, using HTTPS or
loopback HTTP for testing. A per-process cache keeps repeated requests local
until restart. Outputs retain term IRIs, release identity and source links.
